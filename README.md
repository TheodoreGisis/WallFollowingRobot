This is my Wall Following robot using Arduino Uno.The current robot follows the left wall, it has two ultrasonic sensors one in the front of the vehicle and one on the left side.
The first ultrasonic sensor is responsible to detect and avoid obstacles.The second one is responsible to find the left wall and continue to drive parallel with it.
We used a PID controller to find and correct the errors.
